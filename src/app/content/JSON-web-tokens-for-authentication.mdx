# JSON Web Tokens for Authentication

Hello, any and all! I hope your day has been going well, but if it hasn't, I
hope it improves with time! Don't forget to take a break or focus
on yourself, if needed.

In this post, I will be going over JSON Web tokens along with its role in
authentication. This means I'll be covering a brief summary on how the
sign-up and login process functions when using JSON Web tokens. It's
important to know that there are also other ways to authenticate a user,
this is just one of many ways that I personally find to be one of the
simpler ones.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### What is it?
[From the JWT website](https://jwt.io), "JSON Web Tokens are an open,
industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for
representing claims securely between two parties." In essence, it's a
way to communicate sensitive information between two points. As the name
suggests, is it information that is stored in JSON. This object is then encoded into
a series of characters and numbers that can later be decoded by the
receiving end.

[As described as part of the JWT intro](https://jwt.io/introduction),
A JWT is composed of three parts, typically shown in this format:

`xxxxxx.yyyyyy.zzzzzz`

#### Header (The Xs)

#### Payload (The Ys)

#### Signature (The Zs)

Something to note from the signature where it says "secret", this can be any
string that a person wishes to make. I like to think of it like a password;
if someone knows what this secret word is, they can use use it to potentially
decode any JWTs that you're generating.

#### All together now!

The Encoded side on the left is the token that is shared between parties.
The Decoded side on the right are all of the individual pieces used together
to create the token itself.

### Why use it?
One of the more common use cases of JWTs is to authenticate a user with
this encoded string. Let's say you have a system to store users. You send
your information to the system, usually something like an email or username
along with a password that's tied to it. Assuming the input is valid,
this new user is created and you receive a token in return. With this
token, you can now access the rest of the website's services. Similar to
a social media site's system, like Facebook, Twitter/X or Instragram,
once you sign up or login, you use your username/email and password to
then make posts, upload images, bookmark other posts, etc. This token
is basically an encrypted ID that is sent to the server to let them
know that you are an allowed user and it can determine what resources
to share with you.

## Conclusion

JWTs are one of the more simpler approaches to sending encoded,
sensitive information along the web. With this in mind, it's
possible to create a safer user system for one's own purposes,
whether it's for a personal blog or just selling a service. You
can be confident that the information sent between these two points
will be safe and guaranteed to be from the desired source.

As always, for any and all who read through this, I very much
appreciate the you've spent here! I hope that with this, more
knowledge is gained to utilize for your own purposes. I know
it's given me a good idea on how to potentially implement a
user system on a side project I've been working on. Take care,
and happy coding!
