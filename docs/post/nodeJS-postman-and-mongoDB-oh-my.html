<p>Hello to all! I hope you&#x27;re having a good day so far, or even a good
start of the day! And if not, I hope you things can improve for you soon enough!</p>
<p>Along with the Database class I took this month, I also had a back-end related
class. Server-side Languages, which includes the likes of NodeJS, Postman and
MongoDB. <a href="./database-learning-with-mongoDB-and-mySQL">I covered MongoDB in the database post</a>, but I&#x27;ll be talking about it
here with regards to mongoose, an NPM package that makes communication between
the Node app and MongoDB much easier.</p>
<h2>NodeJS</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>NodeJS (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en">here is their website</a>) is &quot;an asynchronous
event-driven JavaScript runtime,&quot; as their About page describes. It is able to
handle multiple user requests, whether it&#x27;s sending data or receiving data to
and from the user. The way I view it is a middleman between the front-end side
(a website a user has access to, like Facebook) and the database that stores
all the data related to the front-end. The front-end sends something like a
&quot;Get all users&quot; request to the NodeJS app, which then interprets this request,
fetches the data from the database if it needs to, then returns that data back
to the user that sent the request.</p>
<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p>As a middleman that typically a regular user has no way to directly access,
it&#x27;s a good place to validate data, check for authentication, and prevent anything
malicious from accessing the database. Of course, that&#x27;ll always depend on the
implementation of the person creating the NodeJS app, but I feel these are reasons
that make it so useful for developers. In also helps facilitate the handling of
data. Instead of manually inputting any and all data coming to and from the
database, the NodeJS app can do that for us instead. We can code a button in the
front-end interface that sends the request of whatever thing we want it to do,
have the NodeJS read this request then do all that we need it to for us. Feels
like without something like this in basically every working website, it would be
nightmarish to work with thousands or millions of data requests in days or even
hours. Reasons like these I&#x27;m so grateful for humans being lazy as hell, always
gotta make things easier somehow!</p>
<h2>Postman</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Postman (<a href="https://www.postman.com">here&#x27;s the link to their page</a>) is a software
that can make requests without having to worry about building a front-end to
test certain endpoints. So if you&#x27;re building specifically just a back-end
application but need to test it, Postman is perfect for this. It&#x27;s technically
more than just what I describe it to be, but it&#x27;s certainly my favorite reason
to use it.</p>
<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, it eases the process of sending requests since it has the
infrastructure built to display any responses in a human-readable way. My
understanding is that it basically makes what used to be something like a curl
command (in case you haven&#x27;t heard of curl before, here&#x27;s a link to their page)
and make it much easier to write the request and read the response along with
any status code it might&#x27;ve returned. It even has a function to convert those
request you&#x27;ve made into a curl command, interestingly enough. Along with just
making these requests, you can also create tests for the requests which are
perfect to make sure every endpoint that you create in your back-end works as expected.</p>
<h2>MongoDB and Mongoose</h2>
<h3>What are they?</h3>
<p>MongoDB (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com">here&#x27;s a link to their page</a>) is a non-relational
database. This means that it&#x27;s a database where the objects stored are not stored
with any relationships to each other. They&#x27;re essentially JSON objects stored in a
database. Mongoose (<a href="https://mongoosejs.com">here&#x27;s a link to their documentation</a>)
is an NPM package that makes it easy to communicate with your NodeJS app as well
as the MongoDB database. It has a lot of built-in functionality that makes it easy
to use and allows for a very similar experience to actually handling data directly
from MongoDB.</p>
<h3>Why use them?</h3>
<p>MongoDB, as well as any other database that is used, is useful for storing large
chunks of data. Whatever it is you want to store, there&#x27;s no reason not to use a
database that is designed for this kind of behavior. As for mongoose, it makes
the process of communicating with the database a lot more manageable than doing
so manually. You can create the objects in your NodeJS app that will map directly
into a MongoDB object thanks to mongoose as well as handle retrieved MongoDB
objects in the same way one would handle a regular JavaScript object. Both of
them working together, it&#x27;s honestly very useful.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the database class and this server-side class taken together, I feel I
gained a lot of useful information that can help me for my own personal
projects as well as just any work environment. Even if I weren&#x27;t to use the
same technologies, having a good grasp of the concepts and overall workflow
is always a plus in my eyes. Immediately after finishing the class, I was
motivated to take a free Postman course to learn more about its functionality,
and I highly recommend doing so if you ever get the chance or want to learn
more about it. It&#x27;s not too long, goes step by step with its features and
teaches a lot of useful features that are either time-saving or useful for
organization purposes.</p>
<p>For any and all who took the time to read through this, thank you so much!
I don&#x27;t have any high hopes of many people coming across these posts, but
if even one person benefits from someone who&#x27;s still learning, that&#x27;s good
enough for me! Take care, and hope you have a good rest of your day!</p></div><!--/$--><footer><h5>Created by Carlos Mendez<br/>For Deployment of Web Applications</h5></footer></div><script
