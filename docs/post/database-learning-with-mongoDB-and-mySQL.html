<p>Hello to any and all who stumble across this post! Hope your day has
been going as well, and hope any other days coming up are just as well
or better, and if not, I do hope things improve soon!</p>
<p>This month, I went over two classes. The one I&#x27;ll cover in this post will
be about the database class I took, but there will be another post talking
about the second class as well!
<a href="./nodeJS-postman-and-mongoDB-oh-my">Hopefully this sentence will link to that post once it&#x27;s up!</a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So, what did I learn this time with regards to databases? Well, a decent
amount, I&#x27;d like to think. The class has us host a virtual machine using
AWS&#x27;s EC2 service
(<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Here&#x27;s the link for the service in case of curiosity</a>,
I feel I don&#x27;t know enough to properly describe it myself). This instance
was created with MySQL and MongoDB installed. We used Mac&#x27;s Terminal
software to communicate with the VM, Filezilla
(<a href="https://filezilla-project.org">here&#x27;s a link to Filezilla</a>,
which is a software that facilitates file transferring from one&#x27;s PC to another
device like an Amazon-hosted VM!) to transfer files to and from the VM and
MySQL Workbench (<a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">here&#x27;s a link to MySQL Workbench</a>, which is a way to work
with MySQL databases in a more visual way than Mac Terminal or just command
prompt itself) to work with the MySQL database with a GUI, which I personally
prefer. We also worked with MongoDB, a non-relational database (which I&#x27;ll
cover in a moment, and also <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">here&#x27;s a link to MongoDB&#x27;s site</a>
and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass">another link to MongoDB compass</a> which is a GUI interface for it) and Neo4J,
a graph-based database system (<a href="https://neo4j.com">here&#x27;s a link to their page</a>).
So, here are the things that stuck with me the most for this class:</p>
<h2>MySQL</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>MySQL is a relational database. My understanding of a relational database
is basically creating relationships between different objects. For example,
let&#x27;s say we have a Person table. A person can have something like a Car.
The Car has its own set of values, like make, brand, model, etc. You would
store the Car&#x27;s values in its own table, then have the Person store a value
from Car that can connect to it, something like an ID, so you wouldn&#x27;t need
to store all of the Car&#x27;s values into the Person itself. Essentially, you
have one Car object in the Car table that the Person table can link to.
Since less actual values are being saved, it helps in terms of storage
capacity.</p>
<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p>Relational databases in general have been around for the longest time,
making them one if not the most common type of database to work with, so
learning about any type of relational database is always something good
to keep in mind, in my eyes. As such, there&#x27;s also a huge amount of resource
to learn from. Personally coming from a more JSON-oriented mindset when
it comes to data, it took some time for me to wrap my head around, even
though it was my first type of database interaction ever, but there&#x27;s no
denying its versatility and speed when it comes to handling an enormous
amount of data at once.</p>
<h2>MongoDB</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>MongoDB is a non-relational database. This means that each table does
not reference another table as the default behavior. So, imagine the same
Person table from before that would contain all the information related
to the Car table from before stored within it. Another difference is how
a non-relational database can have different variable for each object.
For example, Person A has an age value whereas Person B has a middle name
value instead. These differences can be stored without causing any problems
as there is no specific structure associated to the MongoDB databases.
They&#x27;re most closely associated as a JSON object, but in database form.
The reason I specify &quot;as the default behavior&quot; is because it can be
programmed to function in a similar manner as relational databases. There
is a function for the mongoose module that is utilized in NodeJS, for
example, that can populate something like a &quot;car&quot; variable for a Person
that is stored in a Car table instead, which is a function called Populate.
I&#x27;ll go more into NodeJS on my other post once it&#x27;s uploaded, though!</p>
<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p>To me, the way MongoDB stores objects and retrieves them to and from a
database makes more sense. It&#x27;s more intuitive to me as it&#x27;s basically
just storing JSON objects into a database that we&#x27;re just retrieving, which
makes it much easier to think about. As for speed compared to MySQL, I
wouldn&#x27;t be able to say how much better or worse it is, as I have yet to
experience a situation where speed is a necessity, since I do not have actual
work experience with regards to thousands of people fetching data from a
database. So for my own purposes, I&#x27;m currently more inclined to go with
MongoDB as a first choice.</p>
<h2>Neo4J</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Neo4J is a graph database. We didn&#x27;t cover it as much as the other two,
but here&#x27;s about what I can remember from it. Data is stored same as any
other database, but the objects and their relationships are visualized in a
graph. The relationships between objects are also shown in this graph manner.
This can look something similar to &quot;Person A --- has a ---&gt; Car A&quot;, for
example. It&#x27;s a much easier way to visualize objects and the relationships
they have with any other object that exists in the database.</p>
<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p>This was the first time I had heard of Neo4J, and I haven&#x27;t heard of it
being used in a work environment (although it more than likely is), but off
the top of my head, the main benefit I can see from it is how easy it is
to look at stuff at a glance. The connections make a lot more sense, and
you can quickly see if the relationships between the objects make sense.
Since every object can have it&#x27;s own type, you can also easily filter for
object types, specific objects or specific object relationships. It feels
like it would allow for a more human-readable or human-useable experience
compared to the previous database types.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A lot of info for this class, and personally very useful. I&#x27;m hoping I can
actually start using one of these for my own personal projects to practice
with. I&#x27;ve been using a new software called Obsidian
(<a href="https://obsidian.md">here&#x27;s a link to their page</a>), which is basically
a text editor that is written mostly in markdown.
It allows for a lot of customization that makes it super useful for
documentation purposes (at least for my needs), and I&#x27;m wondering if I could
potentially implement databases to work along with Obsidian. I&#x27;d have to
program a working plugin with it, or find an existing one if it does exist,
so I&#x27;m not in a rush to go for it, but it&#x27;s a nice option to consider.
Databases feel like a completely different beast in terms of programming,
very useful but very scary at the same time, since a lot of important
information can be stored in it and potentially lost if you&#x27;re not careful.
Still, if it weren&#x27;t useful, it wouldn&#x27;t be around after decades in
different forms to suit ever-evolving needs.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it from me for this post, I hope anyone finds my insights on what
I learned here useful! Take care all, and happy coding!</p><!--/$--><footer><h5>Created by Carlos Mendez<br/>For Deployment of Web Applications</h5></footer></div><script
