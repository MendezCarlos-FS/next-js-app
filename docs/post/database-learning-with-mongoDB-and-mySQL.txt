d:T448,MongoDB is a non-relational database. This means that each table does
not reference another table as the default behavior. So, imagine the same
Person table from before that would contain all the information related
to the Car table from before stored within it. Another difference is how
a non-relational database can have different variable for each object.
For example, Person A has an age value whereas Person B has a middle name
value instead. These differences can be stored without causing any problems
as there is no specific structure associated to the MongoDB databases.
They're most closely associated as a JSON object, but in database form.
The reason I specify "as the default behavior" is because it can be
programmed to function in a similar manner as relational databases. There
is a function for the mongoose module that is utilized in NodeJS, for
example, that can populate something like a "car" variable for a Person
that is stored in a Car table instead, which is a function called Populate.
I'll go more into NodeJS on my other post once it's uploaded, though!4:[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Database Learning with MongoDB and MySQL!"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Hello to any and all who stumble across this post!
