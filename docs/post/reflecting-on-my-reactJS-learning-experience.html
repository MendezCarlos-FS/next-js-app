<p>First off, welcome to any who may be reading! I appreciate giving your
time just to read over the insight of just another student. Being able
to share my learning experiences as a way for me to reflect in the future
could also be a useful way to provide someone else&#x27;s perspective through
this journey. Hope you continue to enjoy your time today!</p>
<p>This month&#x27;s class of Interface Programming with the React.js library
has come to an end, and with it is a lot of React.js knowledge obtained.
I had a good first impression of React and it certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint.
It felt very robust as a frontend library, giving devs a lot of freedom on
how they wish to approach certain problems. In this post, I intend on going
over some of the more important concepts that stuck with me as well as any
React-specific features that I liked.</p>
<h2>What is React.js?</h2>
<p>React.js is a frontend library that gives developers the capability to make
single-paged applications with small amounts of effort. It has a lot of
options for developers to quickly build these from scratch while still being
more lightweight than a framework like Angular.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>The idea behind components is simple, but very effective. Basically, we
can take any portion of HTML (whether it&#x27;s something as simple as a button
or more complex like a full page) and make it into its own block of code.
So, let&#x27;s say I want to have a button. With this button, I want to add a
few extra things to it, like maybe a dropdown arrow to make a specific
selection aside from just a confirmation. I can create this button&#x27;s behavior
and styling inside a Button component, then reuse this block of code by
simply referencing this Button component in different parts of the code. The
reusability makes it very easy to use common functionality all over the website
and only need to update in one location for all of the instances of it to also
be updated. A huge time saver and in my mind a good way to think about chunks
of HTML.</p>
<h2>Props and States</h2>
<p>Props are a way to relay information from a parent component to a child
component. Let&#x27;s say you have a Checkout Page component that contains a
Button component. You can send the Button component what text to display
within the Checkout Page component as a prop. Then the Button component
reads this prop object to get the text and display it.</p>
<p>React uses states for each component to keep track of any relevant
information. For example, if you have a form that a user will fill up
with some information, like a job application form, you can store the
information that is being inputted and use it where necessary. Each
component can have its own specific state that is unrelated to other
components, making it easy to keep track of each individual component&#x27;s state.</p>
<p>Both of these can work together to relay information to other components
and/or store the information for future use.</p>
<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>Routing allows single-paged applications to traverse through separate page
components similar to how one would traverse a traditional website. For
example, in a traditional website, you can click the About page from the
Home page which will redirect you over to that page. However, it would move
you to that page while having to fetch whatever new files are located in
that web address. Because of React&#x27;s single-paged nature, we can use routing
to perform the same task without the page refreshing, which means there&#x27;s no
re-fetching of files. I like to think of it as if each page is treated like
a quick-swappable block of HTML.</p>
<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>To my understanding, hooks are a React-specific way of handling common
behavior. So for example, before you would use a state object in a component
to keep track of that component&#x27;s relevant information. However, you can
instead use the useState hook so it can handle most of the logic with regards
to actually storing a specific state value for you.</p>
<p>The useContext hook can allow parent components to share objects to
deeply-nested children components without having to pass it down with each
child component. Imagine Component A is a parent component, Component B is a
child of A, Component C is a child of B and Component D is a child of C. With
useContext, you can directly access a value of Component A from Component D
without having to pass it through Component B and Component C.</p>
<p>There are many React hooks, each with its own specific use case, but these
two are the ones I enjoyed using the most, and thought to share it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>React.js has a lot of functionality, way more than I covered here, but I
wanted to highlight the ones I remember and enjoyed implementing the most.
I had previous Angular experience, so a lot of the concepts were the same in both,
just the execution of it was different. Of the two, React.js feels much easier to
learn in comparison and still provides most of the functionality any single-page
application dev is likely to use. I would highly recommend learning React.js as a
starting point to the single-paged library/framework concepts over the two, which
can help to then transition to the other in case it&#x27;s necessary.</p></div><!--/$--><footer><h5>Created by Carlos Mendez<br/>For Deployment of Web Applications</h5></footer></div><script
